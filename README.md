# Chapter 1 Day 1 Quest

# Explain what the Blockchain is in your own word.
A blockchain is a distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network for recording transactions, tracking assets and building trust.

# Explain what a smart contract is.
A smart contract is a set of instructions that is deployed on the blockchain to act in a specific way.

# Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.
A script is used to view data on the blockchain and doesn't incur charges, while a transaction is used to change data on the blockchain and incurs charges.


# Chapter 1 Day 2
# What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?
The 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars are:
- Safety and Security
- Clarity
- Approachability
- Developers experience
- Resource Oriented Programming

# In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful?
- every smart contract must be safe and secure
- code should be easy to read 
- code should be familiar with other languages for easy transistion
- debugging should be easy and errors not had to trace for developers

# Chapter 2 Day 2

# Explain why we wouldn't call changeGreeting in a script.
Recall that we can only read from and not modify a script, hence the reason why we we wouldn't call changeGreeting in a script.

# What does the AuthAccount mean in the prepare phase of the transaction?
It means that the smart contract is granting a particular account acccess to data in the smart contract.

# What is the difference between the prepare phase and the execute phase in the transaction?
The difference is that the prepare phase gives access to data in the account, while the execution pjhase can't do that but can call functions or modify data in the blockchain.
